To generate an admin there are a few steps you need to take:

1) create a normal user using the following credentials:
	name: JCR
	course: MEI
	email: admin@admin.uminho.com
	username: admin
	password: 123

2) after generating the user you'll need to change the level of permission of the user.
The following process shows you how:
		
	1) start mongo by opening a command line and write: mongo
	2) write: show dbs  
	3) write: use TP_DAW 
	4) write: db.users.findOneAndUpdate({username:"admin"},[{$set: {level:"admin"}}],{upsert: false})
	
3) Re-Login again with the username and password and you are ready to go as an administrator.
